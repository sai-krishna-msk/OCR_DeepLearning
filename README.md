This project is an extension to OCR text recognition(bank checks) done by Adrian you can find it [here]((https://www.pyimagesearch.com/category/optical-character-recognition-ocr/), Where he uses conventional approach and suggests that ML or DL could give better results so I thought to give it a shot, 



Accuracy of the predictions have substantially improved by training a deep learning model(CNN) on a dataset of (MICR E-138) font

### Implementation



1) Clone the repo

2) Install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


3) Test the model.py file

```
python model.py
```
